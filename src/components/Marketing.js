                  Big data has changed the game in todayâ€™s marketing and what
                  most people don't know is that we have access to it. Social
                  media has allowed billions of people to connect and find
                  common interests with people on the other side of the world.
                  This connection built also allows for anyone to find those
                  interests, and it allows them to show that person content that
                  is relevant to them. We now have access directly to your
                  target audience. You don't need to find ways to reach your
                  customers, you can go directly to them.

                  Big data has made it possible to track patterns and trends of
                  human behavior. We want to allow small businesses to have
                  access to this network. Smartphones have exploded in the last
                  decade and marketing departments are still catching up. Today,
                  smartphones have overtaken personal computers as the primary
                  digital device for going online. This is why we have made it a
                  point to make sure all our products are mobile responsive.
